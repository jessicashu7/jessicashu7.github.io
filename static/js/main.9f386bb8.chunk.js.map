Although I have worked on mobile before, \r\n    it was my first time working with Swift and React Native. This internship was definitely different than my previous ones at Facebook—while the Facebook \r\n    internships are more project-structured (you are given a project + timeline, and milestones to hit throughout), this internship was more task-based. Thus, I \r\n    got to work on various different areas/features of the app :) In addition, my team had a check-in meeting every morning, so we could talk about what we were \r\n    working on and any issues we were facing. I really enjoyed these meetings because I could give others visibility into what I was doing, as well as learn about what \r\n    other members of the team were working on. Another aspect that stood out to me about this internship was the fact that I was working on a user-facing product \r\n    (in my other internships I worked on internal/debugging tools).
