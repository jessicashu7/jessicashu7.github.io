Aside from meeting weekly to discuss our ideas about our app,\n    we spent several weeks learning about Android app development by using online resources such as courses and videos on Youtube (super helpful!).\n    Even throughout the building process of the app, we were still watching videos to help us build the features we needed. For example,\n    I learned from videos online how to use PHP and SQL to interact with our mySQL database, which was essential to our app.\n    Overall, I am very glad I had this experience, as it taught me to how to solve problems independently as well as know how to find the right\n    resources to push me forward.
